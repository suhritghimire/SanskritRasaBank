title: "SanskritRasaBank: A 23k-Sample Human-Validated Sanskrit Corpus for Computational NavaRasa Analysis"
abstract: >
  The first large-scale, human-validated dataset for Sanskrit rasa (aesthetic sentiment)
  classification. Contains 12,548 high-confidence annotated verses from the Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa and supplementary Sanskrit texts, labeled across 9 NavaRasa categories
  using a 3-LLM ensemble (GPT-4o, DeepSeek, Groq) and validated by a Sanskrit
  domain expert. Benchmarks four multi-lingual transformer models with MuRIL achieving
  88.99% accuracy, matching GPT-4o (~200B parameters) at only 236M parameters.
